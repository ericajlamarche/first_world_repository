<h3><a name="imp"></a>Important Things to Remember When Designing a Page </h3>
<h4>Key Points</h4>
<ul>
  <li class="style13">Accessible web pages <strong>are not plain</strong>, text-only pages.</li>
  <li class="style13">Accessible web pages <strong>do not have to be boring</strong>.</li>
  <li class="style13">Accessible web pages <strong>should contain the same level and quality of content </strong>that any other pages contain.</li>
  <li class="style13">Accessible web pages require as much <strong>human attention</strong> as any other pages. </li>
  <li class="style13">Accessible web pages usually <strong>are adaptable to more browsers, displays, equipment, and connection speeds.</strong> </li>
  <li class="style13">If you design all your pages as accessible web pages, then you only need to create one page for <strong>everyone.</strong> </li>
  <li class="style13">If you design all your pages as accessible web pages, then <strong>everyone will benefit.</strong> </li>
</ul>
<p>The following are a selection of ways that you can
    improve your pages to be more accessible. Not all are going to be available
    and you may not have time to do all of them, however, the more that
    you can afford to do, the better your pages will be found and used. First, several key points must be stated: </p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Consider the content of your page.</b> What is its
      message? What are the essential elements of the message?</li>
  <li><b>Be clear, concise when writing text</b> and arrange
      the content on the page in a logical, easy to follow fashion.
      Less text is easier to read and comprehend, and will more likely be read. </li>
  <li><strong>Use fonts, type sizes, consistently </strong>throughout a page/site and prefer using one or possibly two type faces only. This makes the pages easier to read and to follow. </li>
  <li><b>Think about how your page might be used</b>, and by
    whom. Be as EMPATHETIC as possible (for a real challenge, put on a
      blindfold and try to read your page) </li>
  <li><b>Create pages that help  users</b>, not
      pages, in which FORM is more important than CONTENT. Avoid trying
      to impress users with your &quot;creativity&quot; and &quot;knowledge&quot; of
      fancy effects and gimmicks.</li>
  <li><b>Be consistent with terms, HTML tags/coding</b>, and with how you label
    page elements (e.g., images)</li>
  <li><b>Learn about the HTML commands</b> that will display your data correctly
    to screen readers or text readers. In particular learn about:

    <ul>
      <li><a href="metaguide.html"><b>META
      tags</b></a> to describe content, to identify content features</li>
      <li>HTML codes and how THEY ARE SUPPOSED TO BE USED </li>
      <li><a href="web-access2.html#alt"><b>ALT
            tags</b></a> and how to create descriptive ones.
          There are ALT tags to use for defining acronyms, alternative,
          long text descriptions, and others</li>
      <li><b>CSS style sheets</b> can be used to control text
          elements (size, font, layout) as long as CCS does not affect or prohibit access. [See: <a href="#css">Roselli, Adrian</a>]. </li>
      <li><b>Various format tags</b>, such as &lt;ACRONYM title=&quot;&quot;&gt;
          and &lt;ABBR title=&quot;&quot;&gt; that will display in text-only
          or to screen readers with the description (Acronym or Abbreviation). These help to &quot;describe&quot; in a non-visual way </li>
      <li><b>Form-related tags and codes</b>. Provide
          LABELS for input fields</li>
      <li><b>Tags for quotes in foreign languages</b> (e.g., &lt;span lang =&quot;<strong>de</strong>&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt; for
          a German language quote). (See more: <a href="http://www.translatorscafe.com/cafe/en-US/html_tutorial.asp?pn=hg_lang.html"><acronym title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</acronym> for Translators</a>; <a href="http://www.loc.gov/standards/iso639-2/englangn.html">LC Language Codes</a>). </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Use the &lt;html lang=&quot;&quot;&gt; tag in the &lt;head&gt; tags
      to state the language used on the page </li>
  <li>When coding, <b>use code as efficiently as possible</b> and
              only use elements such as tables or color when they are necessary. </li>
  <li><b>If you use tables,</b> code them in PERCENTAGES rather
      than PIXELS so that text and other elements can be adjusted by the
      user</li>
  <li><b>Format text blocks using formatting tags</b> (e.g.,
      use &lt;text align:center&gt; rather than &lt;center&gt;.
      Use &lt;blockquote&gt; for quotes, not to indent.</li>
  <li><b>Use graphics, sound and video files sparingly</b> and
      only if these will provide information that enhances the content.
      Avoid adding animations and sounds if they do not add to the content. <em>Whenever, in doubt, do not use it.</em> </li>
  <li><b>If you create buttons using image files and
        image maps</b>, make the buttons large enough to select without hitting an
      exact target (in other words, bigger selection areas are easier for
      people to click on). </li>
  <li><b>If you use radio buttons or other FORM related
      selection devices</b>, use them sparingly or only when needed. Small
      buttons (or target areas) to select are difficult for some people
      to click on. </li>
  <li><strong>When offering a choice or any form of response-required element </strong>(e.g., button, link), make this obvious to any user. </li>
  <li><b>When working with <a href="web-access2.html#cb">color</a></b><a href="web-access2.html#cb"> on a page</a> (backgrounds,
      text, links, etc.) make sure to choose colors that truly contrast
      (in brightness) or that do not become hard to read when viewed. Printing
        the page out in black and white will show some problems, but other
        situations can only be judged by researching. View the <a href="color.html">color
        chart</a> to see how colors appear on screen displays. [see also: <a href="#color">Arditi</a>]. </li>
  <li>When using <b>color for text</b> be sure that
      the information is also described using &lt;heading..&gt; tags or
  a border. You can also offer an alternate description in your text. [see also: <a href="#color">Arditi</a>].</li>
  <li><b>If you create a page that automatically updates</b>          data by refreshing the screen, make sure to provide a user option
    to stop this</li>
  <li><b>Learn how to write scripts that work with adaptive
      technologies</b></li>
  <li><b>Create device-independent pages</b>. Remember
      that not all users are using a mouse, or a scroll wheel, etc. Allow
      the user to determine which device to use by making sure to not create
      codes that are device-dependent (i.e., &quot;on click&quot;)</li>
  <li><b>Check your work using <a href="#val">validators</a></b> and also by performing several simple
      steps:

    <ul>
      <li><b>Print your finished page in Black and White</b>              (grayscale) to see how it might appear to someone with visual difficulties</li>
      <li><b>Use validators</b> to find coding errors or deficiencies</li>
      <li><b>Turn off the graphics</b> on your browser
          and view the page as TEXT ONLY. You can see if the page can be &quot;read&quot; well
        or if it is confusing</li>
      <li><b>View the page</b> with the style sheet setting
          turned OFF </li>
      <li><b>Change the text size on your browser</b> to see how the page
        looks </li>
      <li><b>Try to navigate your page</b> using the TAB key
          to move about the page. How well does it move through the document?</li>
      <li><b>Try turning on text-to-speech</b> and listen to how your page is
        spoken</li>
      <li>Have people test your page, especially those
          who might have difficulties with access.</li>
    </ul>

<p>This document is the basis for legal rights of Canadians with disabilities.
  The Canadian government has adopted the document <a href="http://www.tbs-sct.gc.ca/clf-nsi/index_e.asp">Common
