This page is for web designers, with suggestions, concepts, resources, and links to materials for designing and producing web pages that allow access to the entire population of potential users regardless of disability or computer model. These are based on two important documents: Section 508 Standards for Accessible Web Content, and Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 1.0. These are rules for creating pages with accessible content.

      <p align="left">According to a National Council on
          Education annual survey of college freshmen (2001), at least 9% of college
          students have a disability of some sort. It is believed that a higher
          percentage have a disability but are not making this known to their
          schools. (<a href="http://www.heath.gwu.edu/PDFs/collegefreshmen.pdf">see
          report</a>). Later studies place the rate much higher, with trends showing this figure is increasing. </p>

      <h3><a name="why"></a>Why accessible web design is important</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Web pages should be made accessible to EVERYONE
            regardless of their physical or mental impairment (e.g., Albert Einstein,
            Stephen Hawking)</li>
        <li>Web pages should be made accessible to EVERYONE
            regardless of their computer equipment (age, speed, and connection)</li>
        <li>More resources are moving onto the Web or computing
            environment (with less resources being added in print or other non-electronic
            formats)</li>
        <li>More services are being added to Web and computing
            environment creating a greater dependence on computer use </li>
        <li>It makes for higher quality page design</li>
        <li>The purpose of a web page is TO PROVIDE DATA AND
            INFORMATION while not confusing or challenging the user (in other
            words if the site is too hard to navigate, the user will not use
            it or will not get the intended message or data). An unfriendly page
            will not be used </li>
        <li>Good page design increases page use</li>
        <li>Good page design makes you and your constituents
            look better to users</li>
        <li>Good page design is morally right. Create pages
            for others as you would like to have others create pages for you</li>
        <li><strong>It's the <a href="#law">LAW</a>! </strong></li>
      </ul>

    <blockquote>
            <p>Accept  that no matter how hard you work
                at it, more can always be done. This also means that you need
                to decide how much can reasonably be done with your page. The
                Guidelines have different levels of compliance and each is progressively
                more complete. The minimum levels however may be more than enough
                for your needs. </p>
