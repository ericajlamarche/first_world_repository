              <p>According to a National Council on
                  Education annual survey of college freshmen (2001), at least 9% of college
                  students have a disability of some sort. It is believed that a higher
                  percentage have a disability but are not making this known to their
                  schools. (<a href="http://www.heath.gwu.edu/PDFs/collegefreshmen.pdf">see
                  report</a>). Later studies place the rate much higher, with trends showing this figure is increasing. </p>

            <h3><a name="why"></a>Why accessible web design is important</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>Web pages should be made accessible to EVERYONE
                  regardless of their physical or mental impairment (e.g., Albert Einstein,
                  Stephen Hawking)</li>
              <li>Web pages should be made accessible to EVERYONE
                  regardless of their computer equipment (age, speed, and connection)</li>
              <li>More resources are moving onto the Web or computing
                  environment (with less resources being added in print or other non-electronic
                  formats)</li>
              <li>More services are being added to Web and computing
                  environment creating a greater dependence on computer use </li>
              <li>It makes for higher quality page design</li>
              <li>The purpose of a web page is TO PROVIDE DATA AND
                  INFORMATION while not confusing or challenging the user (in other
                  words if the site is too hard to navigate, the user will not use
                  it or will not get the intended message or data). An unfriendly page
                  will not be used </li>
              <li>Good page design increases page use</li>
              <li>Good page design makes you and your constituents
                  look better to users</li>
              <li>Good page design is morally right. Create pages
                  for others as you would like to have others create pages for you</li>

                  <p>Accept that no matter how hard you work
                      at it, more can always be done. This also means that you need

                      Guidelines have different levels of compliance and each is progressively
                      more complete. The minimum levels however may be more than enough
