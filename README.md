# first_world_repository
<h1>My first repository on Github.</h1>
I am learning new code each and every day.  Look forward to seeing what I can do with it.

For my project, I retooled a website from the University of Buffalo Libraries, which talks about web accessibility. If you would like to see the original, go here: http://www.acsu.buffalo.edu/~dbertuca/ada/web-access.html

I did have a little bit of layout issues, but hopefully, it is a good project overall. Please enjoy!
